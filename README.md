I want to learn about a new topic. There are so many resources; which do I choose? It would be great if I could preview the content of available resources (i.e. books, articles, documentaries, lectures, speeches, events) through highlights to quickly determine which resources best suit my interests. It would be even better if those highlights were ranked by other knowledgable people.
